The data sets were given for the company Pewlett Hackard. My task was to research on the employees from 1980s to 1990s on the 6 csv files given to me from the database. 
This research includes SQL database and the data modelling, data engineering and data analysis were performed respectively.

STEP 1: 
1. New repository was created called sql-challenge on GitHub.
2. same was cloned to the local drive.
3. inside the local git repo, a directory called EmployeeSQL was created which stores the csv files and other working files.


STEP 2: DATA MODELLING
1. The csv files were inspected and the Entity Relatyionship Diagram of the tables were made, using QuickDBD.
2. The ERD file is saved as ERD.png


STEP 3: DATA ENGINEERING
1. The table schema for each of the 6 csv files was created.
2. the csv files for each table was imported into its corresponding SQL Table.
3. the table schema file is saved as ERD_schema.sql

STEP 4: DATA ANALYSIS
